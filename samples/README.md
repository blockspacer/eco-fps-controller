# Samples

Here are regrouped a couple of samples that help to understand how the eco-fps-controller works and how to customize it.

1. Demo 1 is the hello world for this component. It's just the controller within a custom world. There's also a moving platform that shows how to make lifts.
2. Demo 2 shows a very rudimentary usage of the weapon system. It features a pistol with a mesh and a reload system. Also, instead of demo 1, the world is an imported mesh.
3. Demo 3 features sound effects and how to add them to the controller.
4. Demo 4 features interactions between the controller and other objects.
5. Demo 5 displays an HUD and a weapon selection system.
6. Demo 6 features impact effects, ignition and explosions.
7. Demo 7 shows how to make your own custom weapon (BFG-9000).
