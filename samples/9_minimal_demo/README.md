# Demo 9 : minimal controller

It is possible to use a lightweight version of the controller, without any dependency for weapons nor special features. It does only walk, run, crouch and climb ladders(fly).

To use this version, simply copy the file light_fps_controller.tscn in your project and add it in your scene. 
Since it doesn't have any dependencies and the script is embedded in the scene file, the file light_fps_controller.tscn can be used alone and anywhere.
